# ZO Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course "Złożoność
Obliczeniowa", which translates to "Computational Complexity".

## Overview

The course focuses on explaining why we fail to find efficient solutions to
certain problems by introducing complexity classes, reductions, and hard and
complete problems. There were four assignments in total: the first involved
implementing a simple Turing Machine, while the remaining three were
theoretical. Both problem statements and solutions are in English and provided
as PDFs generated with LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. Implementing a Turing Machine that recognizes words of square length, using
[Mikołaj Bojańczyk's Turing Machine Emulator](https://github.com/bojanczyk/turingJupyter)
2. Variants of the Subgraph Isomporphism Problem: one in L, the other NP-complete
3. Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis and the Orthogonal Vectors Conjecture
4. Exponential Time Hypothesis and the Sparsification Lemma

The solutions are available in their respective directories.
